      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
          My name is Maximilian Alfano-Smith and I am a rising junior at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
          I am currently a Computer Science Major and I am hoping to add a Computational Math Major as well in the 
          coming school year. I have been programming since the end of my freshman year of high school and have done
          projects in: Java, Javascript, Python, C, C++, and Swift. My non-CS related hobbies include hiking, swimming, 
          and the occasional video game. My latest Computer Science fascination has been Machine Learning, specifically
          reinforcement learning. In my free time I've been trying to develop an agent to play Kung Fu Master in OpenAI Gym
          to mediocre success.
