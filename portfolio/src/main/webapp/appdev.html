          I spent most of my junior year of high school and a bit of my senior year of high school working on multiple
          iOS applications. They are sadly no longer on the App Store as I don't want to pay for the developer 
          license now that I'm not really doing app development anymore.

          The first of these applications was an app called MTG Mana Calculator that helped users with selection 
          of land cards for their Magic the Gathering decks.

          My second application was a top-down shooter called Vigilante Vengeance that I based heavily on the video
          game Hotline Miami. This was some of the most fun I've ever had programming as I got to go from concept 
          to fully actualized game.

          The final application I developed for iOS was an infinite runner game called Number Runner Infinity.
