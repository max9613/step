      <h1>App Development</h1>
      <p>
          I spent most of my junior year of high school and a bit of my senior year of high school working on multiple
          iOS applications. They are sadly no longer on the App Store as I don't want to pay for the developer 
          license now that I'm not really doing app development anymore.
      </p>

          The first of these applications was an app called MTG Mana Calculator that helped users with selection 
          of land cards for their Magic the Gathering decks.

          My second application was a top-down shooter called Vigilante Vengeance that I based heavily on the video
          game Hotline Miami. This was some of the most fun I've ever had programming as I got to go from concept 
          to fully actualized game.

          The final application I developed for iOS was an infinite runner game called Number Runner Infinity.
